# EVE Online Alliance Buyback Calculator

Instead of dealing with spreadsheets, I wrote this simple work

to help other players easily compute their rewards against buyback

bonuses offered by their corp/alliance.

### Current Features

1. Copypasta materials directly from your EVE Online Inventory Window

2. Up to date Jita prices directly grabbed from EVE-Central

### Coming soon

1. Dynamically change the buyback rate from the front end side

2. Add loot to the buyback computation algorithm, currently, its only minerals/ore

3. Login using the EVE Online API

4. Fancy dashboard
 
### Installation

It is extremely easy to install. 

1. You need a hosting account with PHP enabled. You can get a server for under 2 â‚¬ nowadays. 

2. Download the release you are interested in. 

3. Unzip on your webroot folder.

4. And voila! It should work. You can change configurations under **config.php** for now, 
I will add a dashboard later.


Still confused? Shoot me an email or convo me ingame:
